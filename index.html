                            <p>
                                Hello, I am a Master's student at the University of Bonn, advised by 
                                <a href="https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/xingguang-zhong/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xingguang Zhong</a>, 
                                <a href="https://yuepanedward.github.io/About" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yue Pan</a>, and 
                                <a href="https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/cyrill-stachniss/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyrill Stachniss</a>.
                                Prior to this, I completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from 
                                <a href="https://www.iitd.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</a>, 
                                where I was advised by 
                                <a href="https://sksaha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SK Saha</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>My current research interests focus on developing next-generation SLAM systems that construct hierarchical and composable 3D scene representations. 
                                I plan to explore point-based methods as a unified framework for modeling static structures, articulated objects, and dynamic flow, informed by generative and multimodal priors. 
                                The goal is to create adaptive and interpretable world models that support robust, generalizable, and task-driven robotic perception.</p>
<!-- 
                            <p>My current research interests are focused on exploring the next generation of SLAM systems and how they can be architected to build hierarchical, complete, and composable scene representations. 
                                I am excited to investigate the use of generative priors to ensure these representations are complete, and I want to explore how multimodal foundation models can achieve task-based resolution, 
                                allowing a system to understand its environment with adaptive fidelity.
</p><p>
                                The core of the research I wish to pursue is centered on point-based representations, and I am particularly interested in exploring how 3D point tracking can serve 
                                as a unified primitive for modeling everything from the static scene to articulated objects and dynamic flow. Furthermore, I aim to leverage the inherent flexibility of point-based methods, 
                                which allows for efficient map deformation after loop closures. I am keen to investigate how each point can act as a carrier for rich features that, supervised by sensor observations, foundation models, 
                                regress to continuous scene properties like local geometry and appearance, ultimately creating a truly dynamic and intelligent world model.</p>

                                <p>Beyond my technical interests, I am also drawn to entrepreneurship, education, and technology. In the long term, I hope to apply my expertise to robotics systems that address practical challenges 
                                    in regions like India, particularly in areas such as agriculture, service, and manufacturing, where automation can complement evolving workforce needs and improve efficiency. 
                                    I’m interested in how robotics can integrate naturally into these domains, enhancing productivity and reliability while opening up new possibilities for scalable, technology driven growth.</p> -->

                            <li>Thinking is Simulating. Experiencing is Living.</li>
                            <!-- <li>I believe our whole God's systems are simulating entities in clusters, looping individual items' instantiations relatively at times and places closer to their cluster-mates.</li> -->

                        <h2>Language (About its nature and application)</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Philosophy exists in language space and hence a philosopher should first understand language. Language is applied. Language is probabilistic.</li>
                            <li>A Probabilistic trust model is peaceful for the mind.</li>
                            <li>Language, like light, is a physical stimulus. What we make out of it are abstractions.</li>
                            <li>One needs more phrases to narrow down to a meaning/object that the set of phrases (or what the thinker) identifies.</li>
                            <li>We see a color! No! We just experience a color! A color is just an EM wave, a precursor, a cause of the experience which we call color.</li>
                            <li>Every visual imagination is preceded by a sentence/word formation. Imagine a laughing carrot.</li>
                            <li>This world is just language and logic.</li>
                            <li>Language is just complicated action.</li>
                            <li>I consider every word I utter and every sentence I write equivalent to any other action I perform. Like walking and kicking a bag.</li>
                            <li>I do not care how people understand my thoughts, I only deeply care about how accurately language can represent my thoughts. It, which I care about, is a problem of my own.</li>
                            <li>I have an unbearable love for language and meaning. I feel it now as I form sentences. I deeply desire to engage in conversations. Conversations that never happened.</li>
                            <li>Good and Evil are just categories and they don't have meaning at all.</li>
                            <li>The totality of facts.</li>
                            <li>I think we rely a lot on language to propagate and represent knowledge.</li>
                            <li>The reality "continues" to exist.</li>
                            <li>I think solutions to problems of love, philosophy, and truth can be found by understanding language!</li>
                            <li>All meaning comes with language and signs!</li>
                            <li>There are no facts only interpretations!</li>
                            <li>A fact is a language sentence and hence only a representation. Fact Vs Reality.</li>
                            <li>Learn your language game's rules!</li>
                            <li>Language is the most important part of my life.</li>
                            <li>Language is the world.</li>
                            <li>Choice of words merely endorses thoughts. But they dictate the direction of the message.</li>
                            <li>Paradoxes are problems of the language, not reality.</li>
                            <li>Language is not blind.</li>
                            <li>The last thing is clarity.</li>
                            <li>Minds are private, not their expressions to the world.</li>
                            <li>People project their meaning into texts.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Logic</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is logic the same in all simulations?</li>
                            <li>Is reasoning necessary if there is only a single being?</li>
                            <li>Macro is a thinking style.</li>
                            <li>Nothing is original except the whole!</li>
                            <li>Bachelors are unmarried.</li>
                            <li>The idea is to out-philosophize others.</li>

                            <li>My ethics will only ever be direct deductions from my metaphysics. All other accepted ethics will be rejected. Like that of Schopenhauer!</li>
                            <!-- <li>You are a plague.</li> -->
                            <!-- <li>Love.</li> -->

                            <li>There is no meaning in this world. There are 2 cars and 5 pens in this world.</li>
                            <!-- <li>Love is every experience you call love. Likewise, other emotions.</li> -->
                            <li>I think it is only in the mind that one can love.</li>
                            <!-- <li>Love is a man's truest and most creative expression.</li> -->
